sbt-closure
===========

[sbt-web] plugin which integrates with [Googleâ€™s Closure Compiler].

This compiler is a fork of:

https://github.com/ground5hark/sbt-closure#sbt-closure
and is heavily influenced by
https://github.com/irundaia/sbt-sassify

**It works works totally different than sbt-closure.**

Currently this is in a really early stage, so stay tuned.
